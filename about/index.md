---

I am fond of **Data Science** and a **R, Python, SQL** enthusiast.
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duttashish_) and [GitHub](https://github.com/duttashi) as @duttashi 

**Current work**

I am a PhD student (2014-2019) in feature clustering at the Department of Information Systems, [Universiti Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

My supervisor is [Maizatul A. Ismail]((https://umexpert.um.edu.my/maizatul)).

I am currently working on a feature clustering approach to improve heterogeneous cluster purity. My research was funded by [iGRAS](https://ips.um.edu.my/services/finance/scholarship).

I also contribute to R.
